# About

Simple demo for using [data-diff](https://github.com/datafold/data-diff) with MySQL and BigQuery, to keep for future reference.

Careful: as of 24 October, 2022, there is an issue with `mysql-connector-python` and it has to be downgraded to version 8.0.29; see [my comment](https://github.com/datafold/data-diff/issues/186#issuecomment-1286881392). But [they are working on it](https://github.com/datafold/data-diff/pull/262).

Things missing from the repo for security: `.env` and `gcloud_key_tzanakis-bigquery.json`.
